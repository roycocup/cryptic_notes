# Cryptic Notes

Cryptic Notes is a Flutter app that generates a 12-word mnemonic on first launch.
The mnemonic is stored locally (secure storage), doubles as the user identifier,
and is used to derive the AES key that encrypts every note before it is synced
to Firebase Cloud Firestore.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.24 or newer
- A Firebase project with Firestore enabled

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
2. Configure Firebase for each platform:
   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```
3. Replace the placeholder values inside `lib/firebase_options.dart` with the
   settings generated by the previous step.
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Notes

- The mnemonic is saved with `flutter_secure_storage`. Clearing app data or
  uninstalling the app removes the mnemonic and all decrypted access to
  existing notes.
- Notes are stored under `users/<sha256(mnemonic)>/notes` in Firestore, each
  document containing a base64 IV and ciphertext blob.
